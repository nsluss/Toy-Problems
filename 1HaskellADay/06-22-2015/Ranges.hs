From the Go/Haskell by Example tutorial. Ranges.

So, okay, their example wasn't very range-y, I don't think.

Let's fix this.

1. write a function that returns a list from 1 to 10
--}

oneToTen :: [Int]
oneToTen = undefined

2. Store each character of a word, say "haskell" in an array. Now, with
that array, return the third element. What is it, pray tell?

--}

haskArray :: Array Int Char
haskArray = undefined
